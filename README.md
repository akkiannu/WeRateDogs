A project for the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Program

This project is mainly to test my knowledge about:
- Gathering data from various sources
- Asessing the data in variety of different ways
- Cleaning the data that has been assessed
- Visualize the clean data and come up with some analysis

For Gathering-  
Having never used Twitter API, it was a good exposure for me to use the Twitter API and access the data programmatically.  
`Tweepy` was the library I have used for this exercise.  
For gathering the `.tsv` file, I have used `requests` library.  
All of the above mentioned packages have been used in combination with `pandas` and `numpy` library.  
  
For Assessing and Cleaning-  
Have used `numpy` and `pandas` inbuilt functions extensively for assessing.  
  
For Visualization-  
Only used `seaborn` given the ease of use as well how well the default format is.
