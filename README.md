A project for the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Program

This project is mainly to test my knowledge about:
- Gathering data from various sources
- Asessing the data in variety of different ways
- Cleaning the data that has been assessed
- Visualize the clean data and come up with some analysis

Having never used Twitter API, it was a good exposure for me to use the Twitter API and access the data programmatically. Tweepy was the package I have used for this exercise.
